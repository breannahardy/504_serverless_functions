# Multi Cloud Serverless Function
In this assignment, an HTTP serverless function was deployed in Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure to classify a laboratory value: serum creatinine.

Each function accepts an input which is the creatinine level (mg/dL) and returns the output as either normal or abnormal, based on established clinical thresholds.

The rule implemented was:

- Normal: creatinine between 0.59 and 1.04 mg/dL (adult women)

- Abnormal: creatinine < 0.59 mg/dL or > 1.04 mg/dL
